Hello! This is a technical task for Andersen. This document will describe how to use the Task_1.py program.

Download and install the latest version of Python on your computer according to your operating system. URL: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
You will also need to install Git according to your operating system. URL: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git.

1. DOWNLOADING 
    
    In order to copy a project from a remote repository to your computer, you need to complete several steps.

    1.1 Create a folder with a name that suits you (e.x: **Projects**). 
    
    1.2 Open a terminal on your computer

    1.3 Navigate to the project folder in the terminal

    1.4 Run the command in the terminal:

    **git clone https://github.com/avervovka/Zadarozhny_Python.git**


2. START

    2.1 Open a terminal

    2.2 Navigate to the project folder in the terminal

    2.3 Run the command in the terminal:

    **python Task_1.py**


3. USING THE PROGRAM

    3.1 After completing Step 2.3, you will see the following text:
    **"Program started, input your value(s)"**.

    Now you can enter a value.

    

    3.2 You can enter the following values, which will be processed.
- Numeric values: any **float** or **int** value. If you enter a number less than **7**, you will receive the message “This number is not valid”. If you enter a number greater than 7 **(not including the number 7)**, you will receive the message **“Hello”**.
- String values (type **str**). When you enter the word “John” (letters can be in any case), you will receive the message “Hello, John”. When you enter any other word, you will receive the message “There is no such name”. Please note: when you enter any special characters (e.g. %, ; and others except hyphens, numbers and spaces), or when you enter a string in any other language, you will receive the message “Entered value is not valid”.
- Lists (type **list**). To enter a list, use square brackets at the beginning and at the end. Example: **[1, 2, 3, 4]**. You will receive a message that will contain **all the numbers that are divisible by 3**. Example: **{3}**. If there are no such numbers in the list, you will receive message: **"No Values"**. Otherwise, you will receive the message **“Entered value is not valid”**.
Input of other data types is **not** provided.

3.3 After entering a value in the field and pressing the Enter button, you receive the result of the program execution, and the next line you receive the message **“Program finished”**. This completes the use of the program.

**THANKS FOR USING PROGRAM!**
